  \frametitle{Welcome to Nixcon 2024!}
  NixCon is a convention all around the software Nix and NixOS, for \dots
  \begin{itemize}
  \item highly involved developers and users,
  \item complete newbies who want to learn or are just interested,
  \item and any topic, including both private and business use, development, or anything else related to Nix.
  \end{itemize}
  
  However, you do need to have a ticket!

  Visit \href{https://2024.nixcon.org}{2024.nixcon.org} for all relevant information, including this presentation itself.

  \frametitle{Photo policy}
  We have two different kinds of lanyards.  Here is a simple chart explaining what it means when someone wears each lanyard.

  No lanyard means no photo!  When in doubt, ask.  Don't take pictures of the crowd or run around vlog style.

  \frametitle{Talks and workshops}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Make it clear if you accept questions during your talk (as opposed to just afterwards), repeat the question that was asked for the offline and online audience.
  \item Our buffer time is <10 minutes, if you want more time for questions, please plan accordingly.
  \item We will be very strict with timing.
  \end{itemize}
